# Code.io

Welcome to Code.io, a website dedicated to documenting my progress and learning in coding. My name is Muhammed and I'm a self-taught programmer with a passion for coding.

## About

Code.io was created as part of my participation in the 100 days of code challenge, where I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. On this website, you'll find daily logs of my progress, projects I've worked on, challenges I've faced, and reflections on what I've learned.

## Goal

My goal with Code.io is to share my journey with others who are interested in learning how to code or improving their existing coding skills. I hope that my posts will provide inspiration and motivation for others to join me in this challenge.
